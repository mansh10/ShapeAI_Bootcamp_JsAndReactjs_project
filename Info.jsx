      <h1>Iron Man</h1>
      <p>
        A hero could have very many different definitions, like it could be a
        role model of yours, or it could be a hero from ancestry. My definition
        of a hero would be someone that has super natural abilities and uses
        those abilities to help keep people from damage. There are many
        different heroes in the world and i chose to write about Iron Man
        because not only is he an awesome hero, but he is also a very successful
        person, being the owner of Starks Industry, and making it better by
        improving the weapons they make. At the same time that he is saving the
        world he is also a very hard working person
